# Experience Tracker 

Track months and years of a certain event, like LinkedIn, anywhere in your own site

Example 1:  
"Hello! I have **7 years and 6 months** industry experience..."

Example 2:  
"With **8 months** travelling the world..."

Example 3:  
"**9 years** ago, I visited Sydney..."

## Getting Started

### Installing

Copy the jQuery CDN link add it towards the end of the body section

Link the experienceTracker.es5.min.js JavaScript file towards the end of your body tag after the jQuery CDN script link but before your main JavaScript custom scripts. If you do not have a main JavaScript custom scripts file, create one called main.es5.min.js
```
<body>
...
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/experienceTracker.es5.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/main.es5.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

In your main.es5.min.js, you can create one or multiple instances, all with individually set starting months and years. To set the month, add or subtract the currentMonth. Number ranges from 0 to 11. E.g. March is 3 months away from June so you would subtract 3. Similarly, to set the year, add or subtract the year, so if the start date was in 2010 then subtract by 2010 from currentYear

```
//Instance 1
var totalExperienceMonths = currentMonth + 4;
var totalExperienceYears = currentYear - 2010;
getExperience(totalExperienceMonths, totalExperienceYears, 'totalExperience');

//Instance 2
var thinkZionExperienceMonths = currentMonth + 6;
var thinkZionExperienceYears = currentYear - 2017;
getExperience(thinkZionExperienceMonths, thinkZionExperienceYears, 'thinkZionExperience');

//Instance 3
var contractorExperienceMonths = currentMonth - 2;
var contractorExperienceYears = currentYear - 2008;
getExperience(contractorExperienceMonths, contractorExperienceYears, 'contractorExperience');
```

Now you can simply add an id with the same name as the 3rd parameter i.e. 'totalExperience' to the element you wish to output the experience generated text to your website

```
//Instance 1
<p id="totalExperience"></p>

//Instance 2
<div id="thinkZionExperience"></div>

//Instance 3
<span id="contractorExperience"></span>
```

This would replace the contents of the element with something like:

```
//Instance 1
7 years and 6 months

//Instance 2
8 months

//Instance 3
9 years
```
